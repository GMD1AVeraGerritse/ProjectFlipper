When you attempt to learn or recall a piece of lore, if you 
do not know that information, you often know where and 
from w hom  you can obtain it. Usually, this information 
com es from a library, scriptorium, university, or a sage 
or other learned person or creature. Your DM might 
rule that the knowledge you seek is secreted away in an 
almost inaccessible place, or that it simply cannot be 
found. Unearthing the deepest secrets of the multiverse 
can require an adventure or even a whole campaign.
