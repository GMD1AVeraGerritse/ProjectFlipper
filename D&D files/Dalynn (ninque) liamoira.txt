Starting at 6th level, your attacks in beast form count as 
magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and 
immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage

Circle Forms
The rites of your circle grant you the ability to transform 
into more dangerous animal forms. Starting at 2nd 
level, you can use your W ild Shape to transform into a 
beast with a challenge rating as high as 1  (you ignore 
the Max. CR column of the Beast Shapes table, but must 
abide by the other limitations there).
Starting at 6th level, you can transform into a beast 
with a challenge rating as high as your druid level 
divided by 3, rounded down
